<BODY>
Provides the classes necessary to provide a spatial reasoning model.
<p>
The model is based on blocks (rectangles) which are all of a single colour 
(each pixel has the same RGB value).  There are no overlaps and no touching.
</p>

<p>
The model needs to be point based, though I need to decide what that actually means!
